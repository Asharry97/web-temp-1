                    The practice is populated by specialist IP practitioners who have spent years living and breathing

                    The innovations and creative expressions of indigenous and local communities are also IP, yet
                    because they are traditional they may not be fully protected by existing IP systems. Access to, and
                    equitable benefit-sharing in, genetic resources also raise IP questions. Normative and
                    capacity-building programs are underway at MJ & Associates (Advocates & Consultants) to develop
                    balanced and appropriate legal and practical responses to these issues
