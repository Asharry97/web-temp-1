                    Deed is an instrument in writing which passes, affirms or confirms an interest, right, or property
                    and that is signed, attested, delivered, and in some jurisdictions, sealed, which is commonly
                    associated with transferring (conveyancing) title to the property.

                <li class="list-group-item">
                    The deed has a greater presumption of validity and is less rebuttable than an instrument signed by
                    the party to the deed. A deed can be unilateral or bilateral. Deeds include conveyances,
                    commissions, licenses and conditional powers of attorney if executed as deeds.
